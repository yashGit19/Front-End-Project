Thanks for your interest in contributing!

Guidelines:

- Fork the repository.
- Create a branch named `fix/your-change` or `feature/your-feature`.
- Make minimal, focused changes and include a short description in the PR.
- Ensure images remain in the `images/` folder and avoid committing large binaries directly to repo root.
- After opening a PR, I will review and merge if everything looks good.
